Project Description:
With Blossom, we want to give people lightning fast access to all of the possible meanings of their favorite flowers.

In this project, we are going to implement a hash map to relate the names of flowers to their meanings. In order to avoid collisions when our hashing function collides the names of two flowers, we are going to use separate chaining. We will implement the Linked List data structure for each of these separate chains.


Keywords : Classes, Objects, Stacks, Linear Datastructures, Problem Solving.
