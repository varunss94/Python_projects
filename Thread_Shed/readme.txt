Project Description:
Thread Shed has an extremely out-dating register system and stores all of the transaction information in one huge unwieldy string called daily_sales.

All day, for each transaction, the name of the customer, amount spent, types of thread purchased, and the date of sale is all recorded in this same string. The task is to use Python skills to iterate through this string and clean up each transaction and store all the information in easier to access lists.


Keywords : Python String Operations
